Minimum Initial Points to Reach Destination
Given a grid with each cell consisting of positive, negative or no points i.e, zero points. We can move across a cell only if we have positive points ( > 0 ). Whenever we pass through a cell, points in that cell are added to our overall points. We need to find minimum initial points to reach cell (m-1, n-1) from (0, 0).

Constraints :

From a cell (i, j) we can move to (i+1, j) or (i, j+1).
We cannot move from (i, j) if your overall points at (i, j) is <= 0.
We have to reach at (n-1, m-1) with minimum positive points i.e., > 0.
Example:



 

Input: points[m][n] = { {-2, -3,   3}, 
                        {-5, -10,  1}, 
                        {10,  30, -5} 
                      };
Output: 7
Explanation: 
7 is the minimum value to reach destination with 
positive throughout the path. Below is the path.

(0,0) -> (0,1) -> (0,2) -> (1, 2) -> (2, 2)

We start from (0, 0) with 7, we reach(0, 1) 
with 5, (0, 2) with 2, (1, 2) with 5, (2, 2)
with and finally we have 1 point (we needed 
greater than 0 points at the end).
